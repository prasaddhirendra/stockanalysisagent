# Agentic Stock Analysis System


This is an exploratory project to get familiar with CrewAI, an orchestration framework for agentic AI. It is built in pure python with a Streamlit frontend. The idea is to provide a free, intelligent stock analysis platform powered by a team of AI agents specializing in different aspects of market analysis. Investing should be accessible to everyone.
